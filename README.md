# ![] Application Resource Bundle (ARB)

**See [Wiki](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle/wiki/ApplicationResourceBundleSpecification) for more details including the specification for ARB design.**

Application Resource Bundle (abbr. ARB) is a localization resource format that is simple 
(based on JSON), extensible (vocabulary can be added without affecting existing tools and
usage), and directly usable (applications can access the resource directly from this format 
without converting to another form).

In ARB, localizable resources are encoded as a JSON object. Each resource will have a 
resource entry identified by resource key, and an optional resource attribute entry with 
resource attribute key.

## lib

This is the ARB supporting library in Javascript. ARB is not restricted to any specific
platform/languager. Issues in web application has been addressed carefully, as this is
where localization practice lacked behind.

## arb_editor

This is actually a sample app for use with our Javascript supporting library.

## arb_extractor

A tool written in Java to automate resource extraction. It uses a generic parser (Antlr),
which allow it to deal with many kinds of languages.

## third_party

Thirdparty code used in ARB.
